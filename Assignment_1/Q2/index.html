// Q1
// â€¢ Employee Information: Define a function employeeInformation that takes an array of employee objects, 'employees', as a parameter. Extract the name and department of the second employee in the array and assign them to variables 'secondEmployee Name' and 'secondEmployeeDepartment'. Return an object with 'secondEmployeeName' and 'second Employee Department'.
// //Example Invocation:
// const employees = [
// ];
// { name: "John Doe", age: 30, department: "HR", salary: seeee},
// { name: "Jane Smith", age: 28, department: "Finance", salary: 60000 },
// { name: "Alex Johnson", age: 35, department: "IT", salary: 70000 },
// console.log(employee Information (employees)); // Output: { secondEmployeeName: 'Jane Smith', second EmployeeDepartment: 'Finance' }

function employeeInformation(employees){
    const {name: secondEmployeeName, department: secondEmployeeDepartment} = employees[1];
    return {secondEmployeeName, secondEmployeeDepartment};
}
const employees = [
  { name: "John Doe", age: 30, department: "HR", salary: 50000 },
  { name: "Jane Smith", age: 28, department: "Finance", salary: 60000 },
  { name: "Alex Johnson", age: 35, department: "IT", salary: 70000 },
];
console.log(employeeInformation(employees)); // Output: { secondEmployeeName: 'Jane Smith', secondEmployeeDepartment: 'Finance' }


// Q2
// Average Salary: Define a function averageSalary that takes an array of employee objects, 'employees', as a parameter. Calculate the average salary of all employees using destructuring and a for-of-loop. Return the average salary.
// //Example Invocation:
// const employees = [
// ];
// { name: "John Doe", age: 30, department: "HR", salary: seeee },
// { name: "Jane Smith", age: 28, department: "Finance", salary: 60000 },
// { name: "Alex Johnson", age: 35, department: "IT", salary: 70000 },
// console.log(averageSalary (employees)); // Output: 60000
function averageSalary(employees){
let totalSalary = 0
for(const {salary} of employees) {
    totalSalary += salary;
}
const average = totalSalary / employees.length
return average
}

const employees = [
  { name: "John Doe", age: 30, department: "HR", salary: 50000 },
  { name: "Jane Smith", age: 28, department: "Finance", salary: 60000 },
  { name: "Alex Johnson", age: 35, department: "IT", salary: 70000 },
];

console.log(averageSalary(employees)); // Output: 60000

// Q3
// Third Employee Info: Define a function third Employeeinfo that takes an array of employee objects, 'employees', as a parameter. Extract the name, age, and salary of the third employee and assign them to variables 'third EmployeeName', 'thirdEmployeeAge', and 'thirdEmployeeSalary'. Calculate a bonus of 10% on the salary. Return a string in the format "Employee:, Age:, Salary:, Bonus: ".

function thirdEmployeeInfo(employees){
const {name: thirdEmployeeName, age: thirdEmployeeAge, salary:thirdEmployeeSalary} = employees[2];
const Bonus = thirdEmployeeSalary * 0.1;
return `Employee: ${thirdEmployeeName}, Age: ${thirdEmployeeAge}, Salary: ${thirdEmployeeSalary}, Bonus: ${Bonus} `

}

const employees = [
  { name: "John Doe", age: 30, department: "HR", salary: 50000 },
  { name: "Jane Smith", age: 28, department: "Finance", salary: 60000 },
  { name: "Alex Johnson", age: 35, department: "IT", salary: 70000 },
];

console.log(thirdEmployeeInfo(employees)); // Output: "Employee: Alex Johnson, Age: 35, Salary: 70000, Bonus: 7000"
